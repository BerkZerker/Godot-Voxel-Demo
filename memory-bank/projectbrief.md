# 3D Voxel Terrain Demo Project Brief

## Project Overview
A performant 3D voxel terrain demo built in Godot, featuring procedural generation and chunk-based rendering for scalable worlds.

## Core Requirements

### Voxel System
- Simple white cube voxel representation
- Procedural terrain generation using Perlin noise
- Dynamic terrain modification (add/remove voxels)

### Chunk Management
- Chunk-based world system
- Dynamic loading/unloading based on player position
- Efficient voxel data storage and updates

### Player & Camera Controls
- WASD movement
- Space/Ctrl for vertical movement
- Mouse-based camera rotation
- Adjustable movement speed

### Performance Optimization
- MultiMeshInstance3D for efficient rendering
- Occlusion and frustum culling implementation
- Optimized chunk updates
- Efficient memory management

## Stretch Goals
1. Save/Load System for World Modifications
2. LOD System for Distant Chunks
3. Alternative Data Structure Exploration

## Success Criteria
- Smooth performance with large visible chunks
- Responsive terrain modification
- Memory-efficient chunk management
- Fluid camera controls
