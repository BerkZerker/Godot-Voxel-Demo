# 3D Voxel Terrain Demo Project Brief

## Project Overview
A performant 3D voxel terrain demo built in Godot, featuring procedural generation and chunk-based rendering for scalable worlds.

## Core Requirements

### Voxel System
- Simple white cube voxel representation
- Procedural terrain generation using Perlin noise
- Dynamic terrain modification (add/remove voxels)
- Editable world using left and right click to destroy and place voxels
- Voxel size setting to define voxel dimensions

### Chunk Management
- Chunk-based world system
- Dynamic loading/unloading based on player position
- Efficient voxel data storage and updates
- Chunks and render distance read correctly from settings

### Player & Camera Controls
- WASD movement
- Space/Ctrl for vertical movement
- Mouse-based camera rotation
- Adjustable movement speed
- Player physics with collision and gravity

### Performance Optimization
- MultiMeshInstance3D for efficient rendering
- Occlusion and frustum culling implementation
- Optimized chunk updates
- Efficient memory management

## Stretch Goals
1. Save/Load System for World Modifications
2. LOD System for Distant Chunks
3. Alternative Data Structure Exploration
4. Reload command to regenerate the world
5. More realistic terrain with layered perlin noise, with features such as plains, mountains, and forests with procedural trees

## Success Criteria
- Smooth performance with large visible chunks
- Responsive terrain modification
- Memory-efficient chunk management
- Fluid camera controls
