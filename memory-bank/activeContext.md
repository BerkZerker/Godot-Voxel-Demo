# Active Context

## Current Focus
Refining camera controls and preparing for terrain interaction.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented basic Minecraft-like camera movement:
  - WASD/arrow keys for horizontal movement
  - Space to move up
  - Control to move down
  - Mouse for looking around
  - Escape to toggle mouse capture
- Switched to custom input actions (forward, backward, left, right, up, down)
- Fixed mouse capture issues
- Removed gravity
