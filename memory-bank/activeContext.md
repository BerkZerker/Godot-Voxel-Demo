# Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing performance optimizations through greedy meshing.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented greedy meshing:
  - Replaced MultiMeshInstance3D with optimized ArrayMesh
  - Added face merging algorithm for better performance
  - Implemented 2D mask-based face tracking
  - Added efficient quad generation for merged faces
  - Maintained proper face normals and vertex colors
  - Optimized mesh update process

- Implemented enhanced terrain generation:
  - Multiple noise layers (base terrain, mountains, details, caves)
  - Proper coordinate conversion between chunk and world space 
  - Removed test solid cube generation
  - Layer-based terrain value calculation

- Added world regeneration command:
  - Mapped to 'R' key using project input map
  - Proper chunk cleanup and state reset
  - Signal handling for chunk loading/unloading
  - Noise reconfiguration on regeneration

### Core Systems Status
1. Settings System
   - Central configuration through game_settings.tres
   - Proper error handling
   - Default fallback values
   - Easy-to-modify settings file

2. World Controller
   - Direct chunk count handling
   - Centered world generation 
   - Proper chunk positioning
   - Clean initialization sequence
   - World regeneration support

3. Terrain System
   - Multi-layered noise generation
   - Base terrain layer for heightmaps
   - Mountain layer for elevation variation
   - Detail layer for small terrain features
   - Cave layer for underground structures
   - Proper signal handling for chunk management

4. World Generator
   - Configurable noise parameters
   - Multiple noise layers
   - Height-based terrain generation
   - Cave system integration
   - Proper coordinate handling

5. Chunk System
   - Dynamic voxel generation
   - Proper world generator integration
   - Efficient mesh updates with greedy meshing
   - Proper cleanup on regeneration
   - Optimized face merging for performance
   - Reduced draw calls through mesh optimization

## Current Technical Configuration
1. World Settings (in game_settings.tres)
   - Chunk Size: 16x16x16 voxels
   - World Size: 1x1x1 chunks (single chunk by default)
   - Range: 1-32 chunks per dimension
   - Centered generation

2. Terrain Settings
   - Base noise frequency: 0.05
   - Detail noise frequency: 0.1
   - Mountain noise frequency: 0.025
   - Cave noise frequency: 0.15
   - Different seeds for each layer

## Next Steps
1. Optimization
   - Add LOD system for distant chunks
   - Optimize chunk loading/unloading
   - Add proper chunk streaming

2. Features
   - Biome system implementation
   - Advanced cave generation
   - Structure generation
   - Surface decoration

## Current Blockers
None - Core terrain generation and greedy meshing working properly.

## Development Priorities
1. Add Level of Detail (LOD) system
2. Implement chunk streaming
3. Add biome system
4. Enhance cave generation

## Notes
- Greedy meshing significantly reduces draw calls
- Multi-layered noise provides good terrain variety
- Signal handling needs careful management during regeneration
- Coordinate systems need proper conversion between spaces
- World regeneration provides good testing capabilities

## Preservation Points
- Greedy meshing implementation
- Multi-layered noise approach
- Signal connection management
- Coordinate system conversions
- Chunk generation workflow
