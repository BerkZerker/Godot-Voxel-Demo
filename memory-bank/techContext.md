# Technical Context

## Development Environment
- Godot 4.x
- GDScript for implementation

## Core Technologies & Components

### Rendering System
- MultiMeshInstance3D for voxel batch rendering
- Basic Directional Light and Ambient Light for scene illumination
- No SSAO or advanced lighting effects for performance
- StaticBody3D/CollisionShape3D for physics interaction

### Data Structures
- 3D array/dictionary for voxel data storage
- Chunk-based world segmentation
- Spatial partitioning for collision detection

### Key Libraries & Tools
- Built-in Godot noise generation (FastNoiseLite) for 3D Perlin noise
- Custom voxel meshing system
- Native physics system
- AI Resource Tool (for importing AI-generated content)

## Technical Constraints
- Memory management for large worlds
- Chunk loading/unloading overhead
- Mesh generation performance
- Collision system scalability
- Maintaining good performance with basic lighting

## Development Setup
1. Godot 4.x Editor
2. Version Control (Git)
3. Development branches:
   - main: Stable releases
   - develop: Active development
   - feature branches for major components

## Performance Considerations
- Mesh data optimization
- Chunk update batching
- Frustum and occlusion culling (future)
- Memory pooling for chunk data
- Efficient collision shape generation
- Minimal lighting setup for performance

## Build & Deployment
- Debug builds for development
- Release builds with optimizations enabled
- Potential for platform-specific optimizations

## AI Resource Tool Integration
- JSON-based scene and tilemap import
- Potential for AI-generated assets
- Configuration via Project Settings
