# Product Context

## Purpose
The Voxel Terrain Demo serves as a technical showcase and foundation for voxel-based game development in Godot. It demonstrates efficient handling of large-scale, modifiable 3D environments while maintaining optimal performance.

## Core Problems Solved
1. **Performance vs Scale**
   - Efficient rendering of large voxel worlds
   - Dynamic chunk management without performance spikes
   - Smooth player movement in complex environments

2. **Memory Management**
   - Optimized storage of voxel data
   - Efficient chunk loading/unloading
   - Resource pooling and reuse

3. **User Interaction**
   - Responsive terrain modification
   - Intuitive camera controls
   - Real-time world updates
   - Intuitive voxel editing (destroy/place)
   - Realistic terrain generation

4. **Gameplay**
    - Player physics and collision

5. **Settings**
    - Chunk size and render distance configurable via settings
    - Voxel size configurable via settings
