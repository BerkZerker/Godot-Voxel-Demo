# Godot Voxel Demo

## Roadmap

- **Project Setup**: Set up Godot 4+, structured folder layout, and engine settings.
- **Voxel Storage & World Generation**: Implement chunk size, sparse voxel octree (SVO), procedural generation, and biomes.
- **Chunk Meshing & Rendering**: Implement greedy meshing, mesh generation in background threads, chunk updates, instancing & batching, and culling hidden chunks.
- **Performance & Optimization**: Implement LOD, multithreaded meshing, memory management, and shader optimization.
- **Lighting & Shading**: Implement baked lighting, global illumination, ambient occlusion (AO), and real-time lighting.
- **Player & Interactions**: Implement efficient ray casting, voxel destruction/placement, and inventory system.
- **Physics & Collision**: Generate collision shapes and use multithreaded physics.
- **Procedural Extensions**: Implement chunk streaming, region-based generation, and prefab injections.
- **Advanced Optimizations**: Implement occlusion data, deferred rendering path, GPU-based culling, and custom rendering approaches.
- **Final Steps & Polish**: Implement particle effects, lightweight post-processing, continuous profiling, and scale testing.
